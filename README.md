# DS5100FinalProject
Monte Carlo Simulator 

Metadata: Specify your name and the project name (i.e. Monte Carlo Simulator).

Synopsis: Show brief demo code of how the classes are used, i.e. code snippets showing how to install, import, and use the code to (1) create dice, (2) play a game, and (3) analyze a game. You can use preformatted blocks for the code.

API description: A list of all classes with their public methods and attributes. Each item should show their docstrings. All parameters (with data types and defaults) should be described. All return values should be described. Do not describe private methods and attributes.


TEMPLATE OUTLINING STEPS FOR PROJECT TO USER:
# Dice Simulator Project

This project implements a dice simulator that allows you to create and roll various types of dice in different games. It includes three main classes: `Die`, `Game`, and `Analyzer`.

- The `Die` class represents a customizable die with user-defined faces and weights.
- The `Game` class simulates rolling multiple dice in a game and keeps track of the results.
- The `Analyzer` class computes descriptive statistics about the game's results.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dice-simulator.git
   cd dice-simulator

Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

import necessary classes for script:
from DieClass import Die
from GameClass import Game
from AnalyzerClass import Analyzer


Create instances of Die, Game, and Analyzer classes, and use their methods as described in the documentation.
